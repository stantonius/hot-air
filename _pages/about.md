Thanks for checking out the site.

My name is Craig Stanton and I am a self-taught developer based in Ottawa, Canada. I have a wide array of technology interests, which seem to change almost daily. Currently I spend a lot of time on IoT and AI projects, but this blog may contain content from a wider variety of domains.

Despite being the opposite in person, I am extremely shy and reserved when it comes to my online profile and presence. This blog is an attempt to break out of this shell and mindset. I have finally come to realize that this online lurking behaviour is quite selfish - a lot of my learnings have come from very kind people posting online, and despite my phobia of doing the same, I need to contribute in some capacity.

So if you read this and are like me, or have similar interests to me, feel free to reach out and connect or comment on any of the posts on this blog. I like to think I am a stereotypically friendly Canadian who is always open to meet and learn from new people.
